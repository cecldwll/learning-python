## Summary/Notes:
- The Python interpreter is a program that runs the Python programs you write.
- Source code is the statements you write for your program.
- Bytecode is the lower-level form of your program after Python compiles it.
- The PVM is the Python Virtual Machine--the runtime engine of Python that interprets our compiled bytecode.
- Machine code is the low-level instructions of the underlying CPU on a computing device like a PC or phone.
- CPython is the standard and reference implementation of the language.
