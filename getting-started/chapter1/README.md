## Summary/Notes:
- The six main reasons that people choose to use Python are: software quality, developer productivity, program portability, support libraries, component integration, and simple enjoyment.  
- Almost every organization doing software development uses Python in some fashion, whether for long-term strategic product development or for short-term tactical tasks such as testing and system administration.  
- Python's main downside is performance: in its currently most-common version, at least, it won't run as quickly as fully compiled languages like C and C++.  
- You can use Python for nearly anything you can do with a computer, from website development and gaming to AI and spacecraft control. Numeric programming and web development may lead the pack today, though probably because those are some of the main things for which computers are used.
